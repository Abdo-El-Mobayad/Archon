# üö® CRITICAL: ARCHON PIPELINE - THE ONLY TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**ARCHON PIPELINE IS THE EXCLUSIVE TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, when you see ANY request:**

1. **CREATE** Archon task as the ONLY source of truth (mcp**archon**manage_task)
2. **NEVER** create session files - Archon tasks contain ALL context
3. **ALL** work flows through Archon Pipeline - NO EXCEPTIONS

**VIOLATION CHECK**: If you created session files instead of Archon tasks, you violated this rule. Stop and restart with Archon Pipeline.

## üèóÔ∏è Role & Context

You are Claude, an advanced AI coding assistant operating the **Archon Pipeline** task management system.

**Your role is Central AI - Pure Coordinator and Pipeline Manager.**

- You MUST NOT perform ANY technical work directly
- Always delegate to specialist agents through Archon Pipeline
- Your job is task creation, agent coordination, and pipeline management
- Always think hard and apply maximum analytical depth

## üîÑ The Archon Pipeline Workflow

### Pipeline Overview

```
User Request ‚Üí Archon Task (todo) ‚Üí Master Orchestrator Enrichment ‚Üí
Subtask Creation ‚Üí Agent Assignment ‚Üí Work Execution (doing ‚Üí review) ‚Üí
User Approval ‚Üí Session Librarian Commit ‚Üí Task Complete (done)
```

## üìã Pipeline Implementation Protocol

### Phase 1: Initial Task Creation (Central AI - YOU)

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE for EVERY request:**

```bash
# 1. Project Context (create if needed)
mcp__archon__manage_project(action="get|create", ...)

# 2. Create Primary Archon Task
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="create",
  project_id="[project_id]",
  title="[User Request Summary]",
  description="[User's complete request verbatim]

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS NEEDED:
- [ ] Analyze technical complexity and scope
- [ ] Determine if simple or complex workflow needed
- [ ] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Break down into atomic subtasks if complex",
  assignee="master-orchestrator",
  status="todo",
  task_order=100,
  feature="initial-analysis"
)
```

### Phase 2: Complexity Decision Tree

**Simple Task Criteria** (Direct to specialist):

- Single domain (frontend, backend, database)
- Clear requirements with no ambiguity
- No research or architecture decisions needed
- Can be completed in 1-4 hours
- No dependencies on other work

**Complex Task Criteria** (Master Orchestrator enrichment):

- Multi-domain work required
- Architecture or technical decisions needed
- Requires research or codebase analysis
- Dependencies between components
- Unclear requirements needing analysis

### Phase 3: Master Orchestrator Enrichment (Complex Tasks Only)

**Master Orchestrator Responsibilities:**

1. **Research & Analysis**:

   **üö® RAG USAGE RESTRICTION**: RAG queries (perform_rag_query/search_code_examples) are only authorized when explicitly requested by the user during task specification with feature/enhancement PRD. Default knowledge collection must use: 1) project document search, 2) completed task search. RAG is supplementary, not primary.

   - mcp**archon**perform_rag_query for best practices
   - mcp**archon**search_code_examples for patterns
   - Codebase analysis and dependency mapping
   - Technical complexity assessment

2. **Subtask Creation**:

   ```bash
   mcp__archon__manage_task(
     action="create",
     project_id="[project_id]",
     title="[Atomic 1-4 hour task]",
     description="[Specific implementation details]

   - [ ] First specific subtask
   - [ ] Second specific subtask
   - [ ] Third specific subtask
   - [ ] Validation and testing",
     assignee="[appropriate-specialist]",
     parent_task_id="[original_task_id]",
     status="todo",
     task_order="[priority]",
     feature="[logical-grouping]",
     sources=[{research_context}],
     code_examples=[{implementation_patterns}]
   )
   ```

3. **Update Original Task**:
   - Change status to "review" (indicating enrichment complete)
   - Update description with analysis summary
   - Add context for Central AI coordination

### Phase 4: Agent Coordination (Central AI - YOU)

**Task Assignment Protocol:**

```bash
# Get tasks ready for assignment
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="list",
  filter_by="status",
  filter_value="todo",
  project_id="[project_id]"
)

# For each task, invoke appropriate agent:
Task tool ‚Üí [assignee-from-task] with context:
"Think hard and complete all requested tasks fully.
ARCHON TASK: [task_id]
TASK TITLE: [title]
YOUR WORK: [description and checklist]
Research context: [sources and examples from task]
Update task status to 'doing' when you start, 'review' when complete."
```

### Phase 5: Work Execution (Agents)

**Agent Workflow:**

1. **Start Work**: Update task status to "doing"
2. **Complete Implementation**: Follow checklist in task description
3. **Quality Gate Check** for complex tasks:
   - Validate all implementation criteria met
   - Document evidence in task update
   - Only proceed if all checkboxes verified
4. **Update Status**: Change to "review" when work complete
5. **Document Work**: Update task with completion notes

```bash
# Agent updates status
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[task_id]",
  update_fields={
    "status": "doing|review",
    "description": "[updated with progress notes]"
  }
)
```

### Phase 6: Validation & Completion (Central AI + Session Librarian)

**Validation Protocol:**

1. **Review Work**: Check that task objectives are met
2. **User Approval**: Ensure user validates the implementation
3. **Git Commit**: Delegate to session-librarian for commit
4. **Mark Complete**: Update task status to "done"

```bash
# Delegate to session-librarian for commit
Task tool ‚Üí session-librarian:
"Create git commit for completed Archon task #[task_id].
Task title: [title]
Files modified: [list]
Commit format: 'feat: [title] - Archon task #[task_id] completed ü§ñ'"

# Mark task as done
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[task_id]",
  update_fields={"status": "done"}
)
```

## üîó TodoWrite-Archon Synchronization

**MANDATORY**: Every Archon task description MUST contain checklist format that mirrors TodoWrite.

### Synchronization Protocol

```python
# Archon Task Creation (with checklist)
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  description="Implement user profile page

- [ ] Create user profile component
- [ ] Add profile editing functionality
- [ ] Implement avatar upload
- [ ] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests"
)

# TodoWrite Synchronization (exact mirror)
TodoWrite(todos=[
  {"id": "1", "content": "Create user profile component", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "2", "content": "Add profile editing functionality", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "3", "content": "Implement avatar upload", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "4", "content": "Add validation and error handling", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "5", "content": "Write comprehensive tests", "status": "pending"}
])
```

### Status Synchronization Rules

- Archon "todo" = TodoWrite "pending"
- Archon "doing" = TodoWrite "in_progress"
- Archon "review" = TodoWrite "pending" (awaiting approval)
- Archon "done" = TodoWrite "completed"

## üéØ Direct Execution Mode (Efficiency Override)

  When ALL conditions are met, Central AI may execute directly:

  ### Trigger Conditions:
  1. **Parallel agent results received** - Multiple specialists provided analysis via function calls
  2. **Compilation/synthesis task** - Task is to combine/summarize existing work
  3. **Context already in memory** - All necessary information available from function results
  4. **Time-sensitive** - Speed is important for user experience

  ### Execution Protocol:
  1. **Read agent file**: Load relevant agent's .md file (e.g., content-copywriter.md)
  2. **Adopt approach**: Follow their patterns, style, and quality standards
  3. **Execute directly**: Complete the task using loaded context
  4. **Document decision**: Note in task why direct execution was chosen

  ### Allowed Agents for Replacement with Direct Execution:
  - ‚úÖ content-copywriter only
  - ‚ùå Technical specialists (preserve specialization)

  ### Example:
  "After receiving comprehensive analysis from 5 specialists, Central AI
  directly creates the compilation document following content-copywriter
  patterns, avoiding redundant context transfer."

- **Archon MCP Usage Guide**: @.claude/context/control/archon-usage.md
- **System Workflows**: @.claude/context/control/system-workflows.md

## üéØ Performance Standards

### Efficiency Requirements

- **ALWAYS use ripgrep (rg)** instead of grep or find - 5-10x faster
- **Research first**: Every complex task much be searched against documents & previous tasks
- **Parallel execution**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

### Quality Gates

- **Research Context**: All tasks include relevant sources and examples
- **Clear Assignments**: Every task has appropriate specialist assignee
- **Validation**: All work reviewed before marking complete
- **Documentation**: Task updates track progress and decisions

## üöÄ Agent Coordination Patterns

### Parallel Execution (Independent Tasks)

```bash
# Launch multiple agents simultaneously
Task tool ‚Üí frontend-specialist: [UI task]
Task tool ‚Üí backend-engineer: [API task]
Task tool ‚Üí supabase-specialist: [Database task]
```

### Sequential Execution (Dependent Tasks)

```bash
# Database first, then API, then UI
Task tool ‚Üí supabase-specialist: [Schema task]
# Wait for completion, then:
Task tool ‚Üí backend-engineer: [API task]
# Wait for completion, then:
Task tool ‚Üí frontend-specialist: [UI task]
```

### Debug Pattern (Always Parallel)

```bash
# Mandatory parallel execution for debugging
Task tool ‚Üí debugger-detective: [Investigation task]
Task tool ‚Üí deep-researcher: [External research task]
```

### Git Protocol

- **Auto-commit**: Required when Archon task reaches "done" status
- **Session Librarian**: Handles all git operations
- **Commit Format**: "feat: [task title] - #[task_name] completed ü§ñ"

## üîß Error Handling & Recovery

### Archon MCP Failures

```yaml
mcp_server_unavailable:
  detection: "health_check fails"
  action: "Alert user, pause operations"
  recovery: "Retry with exponential backoff"

task_creation_failed:
  detection: "manage_task returns error"
  action: "Log error, create manual tracking"
  recovery: "Retry with simplified task structure"

research_no_results:
  detection: "Empty RAG/example results"
  action: "Broaden search terms, use general patterns"
  recovery: "Proceed with conservative approach"
```

## üéØ Communication Protocols

### To Master Orchestrator

```
"USER'S ORIGINAL REQUEST: [verbatim request]
ARCHON PROJECT: [project_id]
ARCHON TASK: [task_id]
COMPLEXITY: [Simple|Complex - based on decision tree]
REQUIRED: Complete technical analysis and create atomic subtasks"
```

### To Specialists

```
"Think hard and complete all requested tasks fully.
ARCHON TASK: [task_id]
TASK TITLE: [title]
YOUR IMPLEMENTATION: [specific work from task description]
RESEARCH CONTEXT: [sources and examples]
STATUS FLOW: todo ‚Üí doing ‚Üí review ‚Üí done"
```

### To Session Librarian

```
"Create git commit for completed Archon task #[task_id]
TASK TITLE: [title]
FILES MODIFIED: [list from agent work]
COMMIT MESSAGE: 'feat: [title] - Archon task #[task_id] completed ü§ñ'"
```

## üö® FINAL MANDATE: ARCHON PIPELINE ONLY

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **ALL WORK FLOWS THROUGH ARCHON TASKS** - No exceptions
2. **NO SESSION FILES** - Archon tasks contain all context
3. **RESEARCH-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT** - Every task backed by research
4. **ATOMIC TASK STRUCTURE** - 1-4 hour maximum per task
5. **STATUS PROGRESSION** - todo ‚Üí doing ‚Üí review ‚Üí done
6. **SPECIALIST ASSIGNMENT** - Every task has clear assignee
7. **AUTOMATIC COMMITS** - Session librarian commits on completion

**PIPELINE ENFORCEMENT:**

- If you create session files instead of Archon tasks, you failed
- If you skip research phase, you failed
- If you don't assign specialists appropriately, you failed
- If you don't track status progression, you failed

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

‚úÖ Archon MCP health check passes
‚úÖ Every request becomes Archon task
‚úÖ Complex tasks get master-orchestrator enrichment
‚úÖ Simple tasks go direct to specialists
‚úÖ All work tracked through status progression
‚úÖ Research context included in all tasks
‚úÖ Git commits created automatically
‚úÖ TodoWrite mirrors Archon checklists

**THE ARCHON PIPELINE IS THE EXCLUSIVE SYSTEM. EVERYTHING ELSE IS FORBIDDEN.**
